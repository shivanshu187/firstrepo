        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
         Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
         a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences,
          a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
           the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what 
           constitutes a paragraph.
